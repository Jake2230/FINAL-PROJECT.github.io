    <h2>About SDG 3</h2>
    <p>Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Good Health and Well-Being aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at every age. Its focus areas include reducing maternal and child mortality, eradicating epidemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and combating communicable and non-communicable diseases. The goal also emphasizes achieving universal health coverage, improving mental health, and addressing health risks such as road accidents and hazardous pollution. Strengthening healthcare systems, financing, and workforce capacity is essential to achieving these targets, particularly in developing regions.</p>
    <br>
    <p> SDG 3 is crucial for breaking poverty cycles, improving quality of life, and enhancing resilience to global health challenges like pandemics. However, progress faces obstacles, including unequal access to healthcare, insufficient infrastructure, and funding gaps. Individuals can contribute by advocating for equitable healthcare, supporting health organizations, promoting healthy lifestyles, and raising awareness about public health issues. Achieving SDG 3 is fundamental to building sustainable and equitable societies worldwide..</p>
